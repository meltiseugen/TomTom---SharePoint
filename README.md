TomTom - Auto Shared Party Point



NO MORE explaining to your party where to go by writing in chat, no more right-clicking on points and explaining, just CLICK on the map and all the party members know where to go!



This addon works as an extension for the classic TomTom Addon without changing its functionality


It adds the capability to create a new waypoint (using a key+mouse combination) that will be automatically shared and visible by all the party members as an individual waypoint with a different style.

When a new shared waypoint is added, the old one is removed and the new one placed instead. All the other waypoints are not affected.



Add a new shared point: LeftShift + LeftMouse Click on the map

Remove a shared point: LShift + RightMouse Click on it or classically using TomTom RightClick on one and then selecting "Remove"



Features

Every time you create a new shared waypoint, the old one is removed. This applies to all party members.
It is tracked independently of the rest of the TomTom waypoints.
Adding a shared waypoint is done by LShift + LeftMouse click on the world map
Removing a shared waypoint can be done either classically using TomTom RightClick on one and then selecting "Remove"Â or by LShift + RightMouse click on it (this is only valid for the shared waypoint)
Added a different icon for the shared waypoint to be distinguished from the normal ones
